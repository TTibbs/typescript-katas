# TypeScript Katas

Welcome to my **TypeScript Katas** repository! 🚀
This project is a collection of coding katas implemented in TypeScript to enhance my skills in TypeScript and problem-solving.

## 📚 About

Coding katas are small coding exercises designed to improve programming skills through practice. This repository serves as a personal learning playground where I focus on:

- Mastering TypeScript syntax and features.
- Practising clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
- Strengthening problem-solving skills with a variety of challenges.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

Language: TypeScript
Testing Framework: Jest

## 🚀 Getting Started
